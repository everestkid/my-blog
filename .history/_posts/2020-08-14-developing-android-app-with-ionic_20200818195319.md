For past 5 years I have been developing native Android App. For my new project I used Ionic Framework, Ionic is an open source mobile UI toolkit for building high quality, cross-platform native and web app experiences. It was a pretty good experience working with Ionic. Apps are not blazing fast, however you can make a pretty decent app with the power of HTML , Css and Javascript. As Ionic supports React, Angular and Vue any frontend developer can easily make apps for Android and Ios.

Ionic and other Hybrid App technology is not a replacement to native app development, but they can serve as a good alternative for companies who wants to ship their apps to mobile without hiring extra manpower.

Things that I liked most about Ionic:
##### 1. Easily test you app in browser with Hot Reload. 
Native App Developer may remember having problem running Android Studio or Xcode in their computer. You also need to run emulator, which is memory sucker, to run your apps. You won't face these problems in Ionic as you can easily test your app in browser and if you need you can also run the app in emulator or mobile device.
##### 2.HTML and CSS will be your new friend
Native developers may not like HTML Css but they can do your work without much of a hassle. Ion has built in Ui component like IonButton, IonCard, IonTabs which gives you the feel of native app.
##### 3. NPM package to the rescue
If you need any feature there is a high chance of finding a npm package which does the work. 
###### 4. Support Native sensors
You can use native feature such as camera, Gps , fingerprint, etc .
