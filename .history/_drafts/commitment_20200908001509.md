I have been deeply inspired by Kaushik Gopal to write blogs and I am commited to continue writing blogs.In this post I am listing my commitments and goals which I have set forward for the coming months and year.  

#### 1. Writing a blog every month. 
Writing a blog is a new thing to me. I will try to post at least one blog every month. 

#### 2. Finish a book in a month.
I have a nasty habit of starting a book and not finishing it on time. Once I pick a book will try to complete it in month. Also I will be reading books on different topics and writing about the books I read in this blog. 

#### 3. Work Out daily
Sitting on the chair and working all day on your laptop makes your body as lazy as a sloth. So I will be working out daily and try to keep myself fit and sharp.
